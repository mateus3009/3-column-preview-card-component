## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

I used this challenge to remember some CSS features such as **css custom properties** and I finished learning something new:

- `@property` is a "*at rule*" that you can use to define a custom property with a initial value, define if it will be inherited or not and you can also define the type of value:
  ```css
  @property --default-rotation {
    syntax: '<angle>';
    inherits: true;
    initial-value: 45deg;
  }
  ```

### Continued development

I'm going to improve my CSS skills because today I usually spend a lot of time until I see the "LEGO" blocks that I have to style to get the result I want
